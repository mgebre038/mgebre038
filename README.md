### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Makda! 

 I am a Pharmacist and Data Enthusiast.
 I've been a pharmacist for over 5 years and I enjoy working with health realted data. I recently completed a Data Science Bootcamp and I'm excited to blend my technical skills with my background in healthcare. Embarking on a new journey has its challenges, but I am enjoying the process.

##### A little bit about me:
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Advanced uses of R, Excel, and SSRS in my spare time
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: Projects to showcase my ability to work with data and present my findings through various visualization tools. Learning never ends, so I'm always learning new skills.

Outside of work, I enjoy:
- Traveling & Hiking
