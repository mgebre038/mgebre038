### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Makda! 

 I am a Pharmacist and Data Enthusiast.
 I've been a pharmacist for over 5 years and I enjoy working with health realted data. I recently completed a Data Science Bootcamp and I'm excited to blend my technical skills with my background in healthcare. Embarking on a new journey has its challenges, but I am enjoying the process while I'm at it :) .

##### A little bit about me:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: SSRS and advanced uses of R in my spare time
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Projects, projects, and more projects. I'm working on a variety of projects to showcase my ability to work with data. Learning never ends, so I'm taking the time to learn new skills.

Outside of work, I enjoy:
- Spending time in the kitchen: Cooking and baking makes me smile... always!
- Home decorating

- âš¡ Fun fact: Working with plants & flowers make me happy
